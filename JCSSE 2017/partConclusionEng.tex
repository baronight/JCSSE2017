This paper presented an approach to analyze user reviews of mobile applications to discover aspects and their associated sentiments users talked about. The approach applied natural language processing steps such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging as well as topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques. The result is still not as accurate nor fully automatic as we would like because of several limitations discussed in the paper. Several possible futures also discussed to make the approach more automatic and accurate.
