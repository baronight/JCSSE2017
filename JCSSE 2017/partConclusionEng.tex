This paper presented an approach to analyze user reviews to discover features and their associated sentiments users talked about. The approach applied natural language processing steps such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging as well as a topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques.

The result is still not perfectly accurate nor fully automatic because of several limitations where current tools cannot handle misspelled words. Several future works can be done to improve accuracy and automatic. One future work can be a Thai sentiment lexical resource to help researchers perform sentiment analysis easier.

We can also make it as a tool where users can specify a name of mobile application with dates to be analyzed and the tool would display analysis results.
