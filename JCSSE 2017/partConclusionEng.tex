This paper presents an approach to analyze user reviews of mobile applications to discover aspects and their associated sentiments. The approach applied natural language processing steps such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging as well as topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques. The result can provide users and developers with some insights into the analyzed mobile applications. More works can be done to improve the results such as improving underlying tools as discussed in the paper. We believe that our work should benefit users and developers since it reduces time in analyzing user reviews to assess mobile applications and help exposed aspects and sentiments buried in a vast amount of user reviews.
